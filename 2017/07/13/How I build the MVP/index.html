<p>Since I built my last MVP <a href="https://unicooo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Unicooo</a> using more than a year. Spending lots of time to add features I <strong>Guess</strong> users will need.So when I come up with the idea <a href="http://www.youtubeclassified.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">YouTueb classified</a> and looking at my todo side-project list which contain more than 20 ideas.</p>
<p>I just wanna deploy it base on the standerd by Harry Percival</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is our site usable? Is it better than nothing? Can we make lists on it? Yes, yes, yes.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_manual_deployment.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Testing Deployment Using a Staging Site</a></p>
<p>So if your answer is yes either, deploy it now. Forget about the bugs.</p>
<p>###Come up with the idea</p>
<p>I live in China, so it’s not easy to use YouTube since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall" target="_blank" rel="external">Great Firewall</a>. And when I finally start using it a year ago, I found it hard to find channels I need. I’m interested in Tech and Science. What I can do at first is </p>
<ul>
<li>search the keyword <strong>science youtube channels recommendation</strong> on google</li>
<li>click all the websites show in first page. </li>
<li>Build a <strong>channels set</strong> in my mind because many of them keep mentioning about some hosest channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics" target="_blank" rel="external">minutephysics</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2" target="_blank" rel="external">SmarterEveryDay</a> which are awesome of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I do a little research about youtube channel classified, I found<br>which also classfied the youtube channels. I think their application is for data analyse instead of normal youtube users, and they also miss some important categories like Product Review, Unboxings. I totally understand why, when you wanna classfied lots channels, you will just want to limit to 20-30 category because it’s impossible to correctly classfied all the channels in subcategory.So the categories will be 100% correct but useless.</p>
<p>How about YouTube itself? When I search <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkcRYjXjAhsBPVH4aeIPxmQ" target="_blank" rel="external">basketball</a>, YouTube will recommend relative channels in the bottom.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windsooon/blog/master/imgs/how%20I%20build%20the%20MVP/basketball_channel.png" alt="Basketball"></p>
<p>But when I search <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpNcN46UbXVtpKMrmU4Abg" target="_blank" rel="external">game</a></p>
<p><a href="">Gaming</a></p>
<p>YouTube will not recommend relate channels. </p>
<p>Another point is if I going to work at USA, I wanna know more about its culture, but all my subscribed channels are chinese.So <a href="http://www.youtubeclassified.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">YouTueb classified</a> may help. Find your main users is very important.</p>
<p>By now, my base idea is classified some hotest channels for the categories that  users want. like Computer under Sciencs, Make up under Beauty&amp;Fashion, Tech Product under Reviews. Business model? I guess once we get big, we can recommend some channel for ad, Because there are so many new channels wanna standout. Now I start programing.</p>
<p>###Host your code<br>Usually I open source all my code in Github. Like <a href="https://unicooo.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Unicooo</a> on <a href="https://github.com/Windsooon/Unicooo-django" target="_blank" rel="external">Github</a>. Not just because it’s free, <strong>I also think Code should be open soure by default</strong>. But this time I choose to use a private one just for pratice, and I’m really to open source. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product" target="_blank" rel="external">Bitbucket</a> is great and offer Unlimited private repos. I only got one problem when I using it. I misset my ssh key on the repo instead of my personal page</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windsooon/blog/master/imgs/how%20I%20build%20the%20MVP/bitbucket_ca.png" alt="repo"></p>
<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windsooon/blog/master/imgs/how%20I%20build%20the%20MVP/bitbucket_personal.png?raw=true" target="_blank" rel="external">personal</a></p>
<p>###Run your code<br>I choose <a href="http://pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">pythonanywhere</a>, you can use AWS or Digitalocean or whatever you like. But I find pythonanywhere is super easy to set up and their customer service is quite and helpful. Most importantis, you don’t have to worry about the nginx settings or other stuff.</p>
<p>###Signing certificates<br><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Let’s encrypt</a> with no doubt, and <a href="https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated" target="_blank" rel="external">dehydrated</a> is great tool to set it up.</p>
<p>###Choose your Domain<br>Since I focus on youtube users, I use something start of youtube. So when you type youbute on the broswer, the broswer will recommend the website.</p>
<p><a href="">broswer</a></p>
<p>I choose Godaddy for domain hosting. I searched the coupon for buying a .com domain, At first, it work well, the price get 90% off. But when I pay for it, I get payment error. I ask the godaddy guys for help, They said the coupon is invalid. So I gave up and pay about $8 for youtubeclassified for a year.(I can get better price when I pay two years together, but I’m not sure this business idea work, so I choose just pay for one year.)</p>
<p>###Domain Email hosting<br>There are a lot of Email hosting on web, I only found <a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/" target="_blank" rel="external">Zoho Mail</a> have a free plan, So I choose it. After some easy setup it works.</p>
<p>###Add Google analytics<br>For people who haven’t use google analytics before. It will let you know which page you user focus and where are they come form like this</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windsooon/blog/master/imgs/how%20I%20build%20the%20MVP/category_view.png" alt="page"><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Windsooon/blog/master/imgs/how%20I%20build%20the%20MVP/location.png" alt="location"></p>
<p>Remember to filter your own IP in settings.</p>
<p>###Manager Email subscribe<br>I use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">mailchimp</a> to manager subscribe users, They have great api docs, great customer service as well as a free plan.My use case is When user subscribe, we also get the page url to identify which category he is interesd. At first I get lost at group and segment, after some research I found out what I have to do is.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Send email and url to my backend.</li>
<li>Create group use the group api <a href="https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/lists/interest-categories/interests/" target="_blank" rel="external">Create the group</a>, (If the group alreally exist, it will return a 400, but just ignore it)</li>
<li>Loop over the groups by group name inside your interest-category to get the group id. </li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/reference/lists/members/" target="_blank" rel="external">Add the email to this group</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>###Coding<br>I started coding at 2017-06-28, Before that, I build a <a href="https://github.com/Windsooon/awesome-youtube-category" target="_blank" rel="external">repos</a> in Github then submit it on hackernews to attract hackers help classfied together. It didn’t get a lot attention, But you can use Github and hackernews for help, there is so many awesome-xxx right now.</p>
<p>As you can see, the application is dead simple, just use youtube api to get some data then display. as I said, I choose to make it simple.At first, I used <a href="https://github.com/Windsooon/django-hackathon" target="_blank" rel="external">django-hackathon</a> which for hackathon, I just use some hours for the backend, (Thanks for awesome django and django restframework).Of course I know I have to spend a lot of time on frontend to make it look better. I tried full page ajax which gives users better experience. But I found it hard to maintain when the application have more and more logic. So I delete that part of code then rewriteit.</p>
<p>###Business model<br>After I finish my first version, I immediately send to my friends and ask for suggestion. I asked them </p>
<ul>
<li>Anything confuce when you’re using it.</li>
<li>Any business model advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of them are not programmer,and both of them give me excellent advise. Philip said I should add a subcategory. Before it, When you click Science, it will list all subjects like Math, Computer, Physics. I fixed it within a day. Julian said why not let users choose categories they love. These will let user come back. I didn’t choose to implement it right away because is too complicated and I not sure other users would need this. </p>
<p>I also think what we can have but YouTube don’t, I have thought add story about youtuber. How they build their channel, how to maintain. It’s fun to their followers and useful to new youtuber. But finally I choose to add recommend website at the bottom of subcategory. People interested in Math will also interest in Science American website and other science blogs. I don’t have time to complete it yet.So I let user submit website they recommend.I also ask my workmate to use the application in front of me. So I could know which part will confuced him. Where he will try to click. Does he know how to search the subcategory. After that, I change some button styles and some remove some href make the application better. I also learn from my cofounder Jessica, She also gave me some good advise about how to navigate, how to sort the channels. Actully, what they asked is very reasonable, and I don’t know why I missed when I programing. I just focus the structure of code instead of what user really need. So, listen to your friends before you spend a lot of time in a new feature. They may not hackers, but they are real users and they will spend their time on your MVP.</p>
<p>Now we just recommend the hotest channels more than 100k subscribes. But I realized we also stand in the youtubers’s shoes. What if I’m a youtuber, What can the application can do for me. There’re so many channels already, a new youtuber can’t find a way to standout. So my next step is add new channels in it.</p>
<p>###Marketing</p>
<p>I find a list to submit my applicaation</p>

<p>####Quora and blog<br>We answer question on Quora and post comments on blogs about youtube channel. We carefully choose the channels that really useful to the users and other comments didn’t mention.</p>
<p>###Feed back<br>Once again, hackernews guys don’t pay any attentaion on my application, Actually, I know why. At first, it’s not geek enough, just use YouTube api then classfied some channels. Second, it’s not fun and not impressed. Third, As a tool, I don’t need it. You know what, I think so, Before I build the first version, I had thought to classfied the channels by the its title and description use machine learning. Because I just learn something about machine learning and I wanna have a try. And I also thought of build a iOS application instead of a website for the same reason. </p>
<p>But this remind me of a post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14238005" target="_blank" rel="external">Ask HN: Who is hiring? (May 2017)</a> the comment from xando</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, a friendly reminder. I’m parsing the thread, all job offers added here are also available on the map on<br><a href="https://whoishiring.io" target="_blank" rel="external">https://whoishiring.io</a> or just HN items <a href="https://whoishiring.io/search/36.0440/-90.8984/4?source=hn" target="_blank" rel="external">https://whoishiring.io/search/36.0440/-90.8984/4?source=hn</a><br>If you post here, please use the below format to help me with parsing. If you won’t, no worries, I will do my best to get all the things right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy build <a href="https://whoishiring.io" target="_blank" rel="external">https://whoishiring.io</a> and want more people submit their jobs there. Instead using machine learning or geek algorithm to scrapy the data and classified it, he just asked people for help. So I think, Is my purpose to build this application is to show others I’m geek or for users to really use it. And what if I spend a lot of time in machine learning then people don’t like this idea at all.So I just control myself and get the shit done.</p>
<p>As Paul Graham write in hacker and painter ( I can’t find the the original because I read the chinese version.)</p>
<p>People think hacker design everything before coding. But they are not, they just coding-&gt;thinking-&gt;change-&gt;coding.</p>
<p>###What is next<br>Build four side projects in a month. Happy coding.</p>
